# SQL and Visualization Projects

<!-- Describe your project in brief -->

In this project I did some data exploration analysis Covid Data using SQL and Python. Then I used Tableau for further analysis and Data Visualization.

# Installation

To use this project, you just need to have RDBMS ( MySQL, SQL Server, ...) installed in your computer for data exploration. In my case I worked with my MySQL.
To import the data to your database, this depends on you RDBMS. But in case you have troube, you could also use python for this purpose. It is fast and work with most RDBMS.

This is an example of how to do it with MySQL. You could find the complete code in the CovidData.ipynb file. As you can see I've done some preprocessing before exporting the data to MySQL.

```
   from sqlalchemy import create_engine
   import MySQLdb
```

```
con  = create_engine("mysql+mysqldb://student:student@localhost/CovidData")
```

```
vaccinationData.to_sql(con=con, name='Vaccination', if_exists='replace')
```

Once you are done with data exploration, you could import the data into Tableau fo data visualization.
